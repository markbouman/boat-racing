# Boat Racing Game (C++/OpenGL)

This is a final project which I completed for a computer graphics course, with a partner. The goal of the game is to drive the boat through a course, with randomly generated bonuses and obstacles scattered along the way.

My main contributions to this project are rendering the boat from a .obj file, calulating collisions, and adding particle effects to the boat.

This project was completed using C++ and OpenGL/GLUT, working in a Linux environment. Final grade for the course was A+.
